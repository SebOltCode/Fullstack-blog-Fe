# Fullstack Blog Project

This project is running on render.com: https://fullstack-api-fe.onrender.com/

Welcome to our Fullstack Blog Project! This application is a collaborative effort where we developed both the backend and frontend components. The project showcases a blog platform, built with the flexibility to cover various topics like travel, sports, photography, Dungeon & Dragons, or Warhammer. We used React for the frontend and a Node.js RESTful API for the backend.

## Project Overview

### Group Project

This project is a collaborative effort by:

- **ArthurLiebe - Arthur**
- **adnanabdalrahman - Adnan**
- **SebOltCode - Sebastian**

We followed group work guidelines throughout the development process to ensure smooth collaboration and efficient workflow.

### GitHub Repositories

- We maintained separate repositories for the frontend and backend components.
- All updates to the main branch were managed via Pull Requests (PRs).

### Setup

#### Database

- We set up a PostgreSQL database online on https://console.neon.tech/.
- Our `posts` table includes the following fields:
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer.
  - `author`
  - `title`: Text field for the post title, cannot be NULL.
  - `content`: Text field for the post content, cannot be NULL.
  - `cover`: Text field for the image cover, cannot be NULL.
  - `date`: Date field, defaults to the creation time.

#### Frontend

- The frontend is built with a React application using Vite.
- We used React Router for seamless navigation between pages.
- The application includes the following pages:
  - **Homepage**: Displays a list of available posts.
  - **Create Post Page**: Contains a form to create a new post.
  - **Post Details Page**: Displays a single post’s information by ID with buttons to delete or update the post.

#### Backend

- The backend is powered by a Node.js server using the built-in `http` module.
- We used the `pg` package to connect to our PostgreSQL database.
- The following endpoints were created for the posts resource:
  - `GET /posts`: Retrieve all posts.
  - `GET /posts/:id`: Retrieve a single post by ID.
  - `POST /posts`: Create a new post.
  - `PUT /posts/:id`: Update an existing post by ID.
  - `DELETE /posts/:id`: Delete a post by ID.

## Features

### Homepage

- Displays a list of all blog posts.
- Each post shows a title, image, and a snippet of the content.
- Posts are clickable and lead to the Post Details Page.

### Create Post Page

- Includes a form with fields for the title and content of the post.
- Features a submit button to create a new post.
- Form validation ensures both fields are filled in before submission.

### Post Details Page

- Displays the full title and content of the post.
- Includes buttons to delete and update the post.
  - The delete button removes the post from the database.
  - The update button leads to a form to update the post’s title and content.

## Backend API

### GET /posts

- **Description**: Retrieve all posts.
- **Response**: A JSON array of all posts.

### GET /posts/:id

- **Description**: Retrieve a single post by ID.
- **Response**: A JSON object of the post.

### POST /posts

- **Description**: Create a new post.
- **Request Body**: JSON object with post fields.
- **Response**: The newly created post as a JSON object.

### PUT /posts/:id

- **Description**: Update an existing post by ID.
- **Request Body**: JSON object with post fields.
- **Response**: The updated post as a JSON object.

### DELETE /posts/:id

- **Description**: Delete a post by ID.
- **Response**: A success message or the deleted post as a JSON object.

## Planning and Development Tips

- Prioritized functionality over aesthetics.
- Focused on mocking the response format from the backend to accelerate frontend development.
- Conducted daily stand-ups to keep track of progress and address any blockers.
- Maintained organization and used tools like Trello for task management.
- Sought help whenever stuck for more than 30 minutes to ensure continuous progress.

## Conclusion

This project provided us with hands-on experience in building a fullstack application using React for the frontend and Node.js with PostgreSQL for the backend. We hope you enjoy exploring our blog platform as much as we enjoyed building it! ❤️
